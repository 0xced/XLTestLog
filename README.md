# XLTestLog

**XLTestLog** is a lightweight library for stylish XCTest logs. It makes your testing logs more readable in Xcode Console.

 - Reformat the log messages to make them more readable.
 - Use indentations and Emoji bullets to distinguish between different logs.
 - Paint log messages and highlight important keywords using [XcodeColors].

The original test code is simple **(one passed test, one failed test, one measure task, and one message from`NSLog()`)** but has poor readability in Xcode Console without XLTestLog:

```objc
@implementation XLTestLogDevTests

- (void)testPassedCase {
  XCTAssert(YES, @"Pass");
  NSLog(@"This is a message from `NSLog()`.");
}

- (void)testFailureCase {
  XCTAssert(NO, @"Fail");
}

- (void)testPerformanceExample {
  // This is an example of a performance test case.
  [self measureBlock:^{
    int j = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
      j += i;
    }
  }];
}
@end
```


## Release Notes

### You should also install XcodeColors

Currently, you should use XLTestLog with [XcodeColors]. If you don't, it would show the color code in the logs.

In the next release, XLTestLog will [read the environment variable `XcodeColors`](https://github.com/robbiehanson/XcodeColors#option-1-manual-use--custom-macros) to decide whether using XcodeColors to paint log messages or not.



## Installation

Before installing XLTestLog, please read the section **Release Notes**.

### via CocoaPods

You can install XLTestLog simply via [CocoaPods]:

```
